        <h2>I have a dog</h2>

        <p>His name is Pepe. He is <em>approximately</em> 11 years old. I adopted him in 2015, shortly after moving to the Quad Cities. He has lived in <strong>three</strong> different homes with me! <br><br>
        He is my best friend that has supported me so much in the last 6 years. </p>
        <h3>His Looks</h3>
        <p>He has a deer head and short, tan hair. He has big brown eyes. He has a long body, almost like a weiner dog. He is taller than most chihuahuas I have seen. He is around 11 pounds (He probably needs to lose a pound or two)</p>
        <h3>His Attitude</h3>
        <p>He loves to cuddle with me. I think he'd honestly cuddle with anyone as long as there is a blanket involved. He likes to crawl under blankets and lie against people so he is extra warm. <br><br>
        He likes walks. he gets overly exhausted from being very excited in the beginning, but once he calms down we usually get in a 2 mile walk! He is scared of children and some men scare him, but that unfortunately is a common thing with shelter dogs.</p>
